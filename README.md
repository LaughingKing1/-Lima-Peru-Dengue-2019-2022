Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Dengue Incidence in Lima, Peru 2019-2022.

## Description
This is the code I used to analyse Dengue data in Peru from 2019 to 2022.
The project was my masters thesis for the London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine.

The main research aim was to see the effect of spatial, environmental, geographic, and socio-economic factors on dengue incidence for the Province of Lima Peru.

All of my analysis was done in R and a bulk of it is data cleaning of public access data. 

The functionality of this code is very specefic and may only apply to people doing similar projects. 

I'm new to both R and to Github so my code is probably not the most streamlined so take that for what it is...
